# Purpose

This repo is simply an environment for me to experiment with using new features (new to me) of GitHub repos. One of our tasks is exploring DevOps (i.e., code operations) on Databricks. We have a shared repo for the class, but I didn't want to accidentally clutter that repo with problems.

# More specific

This repo is meant to be a "staging" environment where developers can request to have new updates staged by an admin.  
This is the first testing phase (I think ... maybe there should/could be some in the development stages).  
.  
To have new code moved in here, I envision some initial basic tests. Then, once the code is staged in this repo, there would be additional strenuous testing that ensures the code is ready for production.
